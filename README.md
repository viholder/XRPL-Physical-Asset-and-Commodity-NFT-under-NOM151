# XRPL-Physical-Asset-and-commodity-NFT-and-Token-Generator
The XRPL Physical Asset and Commodity NFT and Token Generator is a tool designed to facilitate the creation and management of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within the XRPL.

This code establishes a seamless connection between XRPL portfolios in Viholder and NFTs representing physical collateral, ensuring legal validity under Mexican law. It serves as a global use case, showcasing the integration of collateral-supported tokens within a scalable framework.

This code makes the relationship between the issuance of tokens and NFTs and Mexican government-backed digital contracts. By leveraging advanced electronic signatures and preservation certificates under the NOM-151, this integration ensures legal presumption of attribution, non-repudiation guarantees, and integrity of electronic documents. The commit also highlights the role of certification service providers, such as the Tax Administration Service, in supporting advanced electronic signatures for enhanced security and legal validity. The implementation ensures that electronic documents, when signed and preserved appropriately, hold the same legal weight as handwritten signatures, providing a secure and trusted framework for tokenization within the Mexican legal context.
