<b>Contracts Tied to Physical Inventory via XRP NFTs</b><br>

# XRPL-Physical-Asset-and-Commodity-NFT-under-NOM151
The XRPL Physical Asset and Commodity NFT under NOM-151 Generator is a tool designed to facilitate the creation and management of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) within the XRPL.

This code establishes a seamless connection between XRPL portfolios in Viholder and NFTs representing physical collateral, ensuring legal validity under Mexican law. It serves as a global use case, showcasing the integration of collateral-supported tokens within a scalable framework.

This code makes the relationship between the NFTs and Mexican government-backed digital contracts. By leveraging advanced electronic signatures and preservation certificates under the NOM-151, this integration ensures legal presumption of attribution, non-repudiation guarantees, and integrity of electronic documents. The commit also highlights the role of certification service providers, such as the Tax Administration Service, in supporting advanced electronic signatures for enhanced security and legal validity. The implementation ensures that electronic documents, when signed and preserved appropriately, hold the same legal weight as handwritten signatures, providing a secure and trusted framework for tokenization within the Mexican legal context.

<h2>Validated Proof of Concept: </h2><br>Our proof of concept is the first Tequila Tokenization or DLT registration of Futures Contract, a validated and functional tequila contract venture that modernizes and streamlines payments and private contracts in the tequila industry. This innovation leverages software, international banking laws, and corporate vehicles to improve efficiency.
This private contract allows participants to benefit from future price movements of the underlying asset while influencing its quality and price. Trusted by industry leaders, US lawyers, distilleries, clients, suppliers, agave farmers, celebrities, and family members, this innovative model fosters financial inclusion by enabling small participants to access opportunities typically reserved for larger players.
The model also incorporates features for eCommerce and payment platforms, such as the Sayuwallet ecosystem, as well as data visualization tools for businesses and participants through the Viholder platform. It bridges the inclusion of real-world assets on DLT and the creation of legal and fiscal proof of date contracts and proof of the existence of the assets, with the first deployment in Mexico. Additionally, the platform promotes sustainability and social impact, leveraging the XRPL for projects that benefit society and the environment.

<h2>Contract creation:  </h2><br>

Contracts can come in a variety of types and behaviors, each designed to suit different investment goals and risk appetites. Here are some common types of contracts that users may encounter:

![create-contract](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128828242/227732547-76d079f1-0131-4873-9165-c39cd0757b49.png)

<b>Futures:</b> Futures contracts allow investors to buy or sell a specific asset at a predetermined price and date in the future. They are often used by traders looking to hedge against price fluctuations or speculate on the future value of an asset.<br><br>

<b>Options:</b> Options contracts give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price and date in the future. They are often used as a form of insurance or to generate income through selling options contracts.<br><br>

<b>Tokens:</b> Token contracts are a type of smart contract that can represent a variety of assets, such as digital tokens or shares of a company. They are often used in initial coin offerings (ICOs) or other forms of fundraising, and can be designed to distribute rewards or voting rights to token holders.<br><br>

<b>Crowdfunding</b>: Crowdfunding contracts allow multiple investors to contribute funds towards a specific project or venture. They are often used to raise money for startups or social causes, and can provide investors with a share of the profits or rewards associated with the project.<br><br>

<h2>Contract Administrtation:  </h2><br>
As the owner of a contract, you will have access to a range of tools and features that allow you to administer and monitor its performance over time.<br> These tools can provide valuable insights.<br><br>

![contract-admin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128828242/227732985-040c2321-f3ad-4f07-837e-14156db8e53d.png)

<h2>Portfolio:  </h2><br>
One of the key features is the ability for users to monitor their contract positions and balances in real-time. This allows participants to stay up-to-date on the performance of their investments and make informed decisions about when to buy or sell their contracts.
<br><br>

![porfolio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128828242/227733312-3e224b2e-15a6-4de4-8bf0-2694574a176e.png)

<br><br>
Typically, this information is displayed in a dedicated "Portfolio" section of the contract platform. Here, users can view their current positions, including the types of contracts they are invested in, the amount of XRP locked in escrow, and the current value of their investments.
<br><br>

![sale-units-position](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128828242/227733322-de15ba77-7126-4fda-9aad-a46ce01b3cf2.png)

<br><br>
In addition to contract positions, the portfolio section may also display important details about each contract, such as the expiration date, the strike price, and any associated fees or charges.
<br>


<h2> XRP Wallet </h2>
Both the user and the contract owner will typically have an XRP wallet associated with their account on the contract platform. These wallets allow them to transfer, deposit, or use funds as needed, providing a convenient and flexible way to manage their investments.
<br>
For users, their XRP wallet may be used to fund their contract positions, withdraw payouts, or transfer funds to other users or external wallets. They may also be able to deposit additional XRP into their wallet at any time, depending on the terms and conditions of their account.
<br>
<h2> Viholder XRP ecosystem </h2>
Currently, the platform is experiencing the growth of an organic ecosystem. Many projects that have created contracts through the platform continue to use the XRP technology and the platform itself. This is a testament to the robustness and reliability of the platform, as well as the benefits that it provides to users.<br>
<br>
The use of XRP technology and the platform also provides users with several benefits, including fast and secure transactions, low fees, and the ability to easily exchange different types of assets.<br>
<br>
Some of the projects that have already successfully used the platform are:

<br>
-Tequila Don Rich<br>
-Metales Barajas <br>
-Simplicapital <br>
-Sayuwallet <br>


<h2> Live working Version:</h2>
Please note that while the contract platform is currently under development, there is a working version available for users to explore and test. You can visit the platform at <a href="https://viholder.com">viholder.com</a> to see how it works and familiarize yourself with its features and capabilities

<h2> Technical Design</h2>

Once a contract is created in Viholder it is configured and saved. The system will search to see if that contract has already been signed electronically.

So with this function we connect to the Viholder database and we will search if it is already electronically signed and if it is electronically signed. We are going to store that hash with in this variable. From there we are going to see if you already have an assigned XRP portfolio. If you do not have it, create it and if you do, it means that it is no longer necessary to continue with the entire process. If you don't have it, we are going to create the portfolio.

We created a portfolio related to the contract and the user, the user who owns the contract, the company that owns the contract. We created it by saving the three values in our database, including the XRP seed. To later make transactions with that same portfolio.

To activate the created wallet we send XRP and in that same transaction we send the seed of the wallet to whom we send. We already created it, we already activated it.

Here, we are sending you the XRP. Here we are all the information of the portfolio with the seed of who sends the XRP here.

We sign the deal. It is a payment operation with the amount sent and the recipient's information. Then we transmit our our signature.

It is worth mentioning that all this is executed on the secure and private server side, this does not really send the seed, nor the passwords. Sensitive information is not transmitted over the Internet, the action is carried out on a private and secure server.

What is transmitted over the Internet to the public XRP server is the hash of the already signed transaction.

We are already disconnected from the Ledger.

We are going to create the inventory relationship or the relationship between the contract signed with an advanced electronic signature, proof of conservation of a trusted service provider authorized by the Ministry of Economy, with the portfolio that was created for the user or for the contract, or the contract and the owner of the contract.

We program it to be an NFT and we enter the hash of the contract signed with all the legal attributes according to NOM 151. From this step forward  the NFT of the contract can be transmitted to other users within the XRP ledger. If we want to put a fee for each transaction, we can program it with this function.

We reconnect to Ledger and for that we need the seed of who is going to create it. In this case it is the same contract portfolio. We put the hash. It is worth mentioning that we have this field to enter information of 256 characters. The hash of the Unique Document Identifier is 64 characters long. Therefore, any of these hashes  of any signed contract fits perfectly here.

The hash of the unique identifier of the document signed in accordance with the provisions of the Advanced Electronic Signature Law and the Commercial Code using certificates issued by a Certification Service Provider has the same legal validity as a handwritten signature as well as presumption of integrity and presumption signature attribution.

Here we create it and send the transaction. If everything is correct. We have an NFT created with hash of regulation 151, the Advanced Electronic Signature Law and the Commercial Code, thus generating an NFT in XRPL legally backed by a physical asset.

This is the Viholder code that makes it possible.
